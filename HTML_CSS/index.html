                <p>We believe the bond between people and pets help create a better society. Owning a cat can mean a
                    happy and fulfilling life together, but it’s your responsibility – for the sake of both you and your
                    cat, to find the right one.</p>
                <p>We understand how the bond between people and pets differs for each
                    owner; that’s why we'll show you which breeds are most suited to your answers, as well as those who
                    might not be</p>

                <p>The Cornish Rex is distinguished from all other breeds by its extremely soft, wavy coat and racy
                    type.
                    The cat is surprisingly heavy and warm to the touch. All contours of the Cornish Rex are gently
                    curved. Additionally - Cornish Rex cats are also hypoallergenic.
